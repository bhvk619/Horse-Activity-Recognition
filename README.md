# Horse-Activity-Recognition
The dataset consists of 2000 datapoints and each entry of the list contains one event. Each event contains a time series with 10 features for each timestamp. The amount of timesteps for each event varies.
The dataset consists of two classes with 89% of data belonging to one class and 11% belonging to other class. 
The main objective of this project is have correct predictions with minimal false positive rate. 
As it is a time series, variants of LSTM (Long short term memory) has been selected for developing the model.
